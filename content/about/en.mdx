## 🚀 My Journey

I am a **Data Engineer** with a problem-solving mindset and a focus on scalability. My passion lies in building the "arteries" that move a company's intelligence: **robust, secure, and high-performance data pipelines**.

I believe that data isn't just records in a database; they are strategic assets. Therefore, my focus is on ensuring the quality and availability of these assets from ingestion to final consumption by data scientists and BI analysts.

  **Technical Philosophy:** "Clean code and resilient architecture are worth more than any trending tool. Data must be reliable to be useful."

## 🛠️ What is my expertise?

Over the years, I have refined my skills to master the modern data ecosystem. Currently, my day-to-day involves:

* **Data Lake & Lakehouse Architecture:** Design and implementation using S3, Delta Lake, and Databricks.
* **ETL/ELT Pipelines:** Building automated flows with Python (PySpark) and orchestration tools like Apache Airflow.
* **Data Modeling:** Applying concepts of Star Schema, Snowflake, and Data Vault modeling.
* **Security and Governance:** Implementation of access policies, encryption, and data privacy compliance (GDPR/LGPD).

## 🥋 Beyond the Keyboard

When I'm not optimizing SQL queries or tuning Spark clusters, you'll likely find me practicing **Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ)**. The discipline and strategy required on the mats are the same I apply to solving complex bugs in the middle of the night: patience, technique, and resilience.
